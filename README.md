# Conditional-Control-Statements
🔁 Control Statements
Control statements alter the normal flow of execution in a program. They help in jumping from one part of the code to another based on conditions or logic.

break – Terminates the nearest enclosing loop.

continue – Skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.

pass – A null operation; it does nothing and is used as a placeholder.

🔄 Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

if – Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

elif (else if) – Checks another condition if the previous one was false.

else – Executes a block of code if all previous conditions were false.
